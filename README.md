Project Name: Al Ain Bottled water website

Project description: It is a website designed to be an advertisement for Al Ain bottle water. Furthermore, the website contains an informative and responsive element. I aimed to make a website that could not only be convenient for use, but also informative in a sense that it is responsive. 

Process: Firstly, I added head row that includes logo and title. Then, I wrote and introductory sentence, and embeded the video. The video tag did not support videos with .mov extension, therefore I had to convert the file with .mov extension .mp4 extension. Moreover, to make the website and the video immersive I made like and dislike button and a counter for each. I had to use javascript to keep the counter and increase by 1 when it is clicked. It incresaes by one every time it is clicked, so it is not an accurate demonstration of a normal like and dislike button where user can only clock once. To further improve it, I needed the usage of php and SQL. After that, I implemented 3 photos about bottled water, which contains informations and facts about it that shows up when the cursor hovers over the picture. Under that, I made accordion that drops down to show more information. Besides that, I also implemented a form that asks for a required and not required informations about the user, that is linked to a csv file that is attached. Under that, I made a footer segment that had the title and the logo, and contact email. 

Reflection\Evaluation: Although there were few elements that I was planning to add, but because of the content, I deemed that it was unnecessary. I believe that I reached my goal in terms of interactivity, but I think that it further needs improvement on the actual design, as i feel that it does not come quite close to an actual website, maybe due to the fact that it does not contain a certain fluidity and convenience that websites contain. Other than that, I do think that it met the standard for a 'first website'.

Project Name: How to Bury a Body

Project Description: This project entails a step by step procedure to bury a body. The main goal of this project is to imply a sense of humour through visual elements while also containing informative and immresive experience.

Process: My contribution to the group project was to edit the videos. I focused on fluid transtion between scenes that is in line with the basic theme of the video. Furthermore, adding aftereffects, an on-display texts to enrichen the video was also a priority.

Reflection/Evaluation: At first, I had difficulty understanding where the scenes should be ordered and how to edit the background audios to make the video seem smoother. However, after several attempts, I was able to sort it out and further enhanced the video with better and suitable effects. i believe that our group did this project fairly well, with fair task division, and certain milestones were achieved during the project.
